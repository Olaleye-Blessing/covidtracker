# COVID Data Tracker

View chart tracking cases, deaths, recovered, active and critical situation.

It's created with nextjs.

`Update: ` Decided to move it from just **[two pages](https://covidtracker-7e7unjw1u-olaleye-blessing.vercel.app/)** to **_[multi pages](https://covidtracker-umber.vercel.app/)_**

## Why I worked on this project

My goal was to learn how **[tailwindcss works](https://tailwindcss.com/)** and broaden my knowledge on **[nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)** after learning how nextjs works by building [TRIDATON(this project shows countries' information)](https://countries-ruddy-seven.vercel.app/).

## How to navigate this project

~~**It's a two-page project**~~

It's now 5-page project

I used pull requests throughout the updating: [Example PR](https://github.com/Olaleye-Blessing/covidtracker/pull/6)

[Pages folder](https://github.com/Olaleye-Blessing/covidtracker/tree/master/pages) contains all pages file

## If I had more time, I would change this

-   refactor some of the code
-   improve the map displayed on [homepage](https://covidtracker-umber.vercel.app/)
-   add content to [Symptoms page](https://covidtracker-umber.vercel.app/symptoms)
-   remove unnecessary comment
